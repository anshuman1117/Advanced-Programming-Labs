# Advanced Programming Lab Assignments

A repository if all the lab assignments that were completed by me in Advanced Programming, in the third semester.

## Getting to know more

All of these labs require us to implement the OOP concepts taught in the course. The labs become progressively tougher and the course culminates with a capstone project that was done after the mid-semester break from October till December.

<!--
Each lab has a question and a set of queries and sub-tasks to implement and a strict rubric for the labs to be evaluated on:	



### Laboratory 1 

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
